# P14 â€“ Future Extensions Backlog (Priority 4)

Items intentionally deferred from PoC, to evaluate later.

## Backlog
| ID | Idea | Description | Rationale for Defer |
|----|------|-------------|---------------------|
| FUT-1 | Pronunciation Assessment API | Integrate Azure Speech Pronunciation for phoneme-level feedback. | Requires additional pricing & complexity. |
| FUT-2 | Realtime Coaching Agent | Interactive prompts during speaking. | Could distract core Part 2 timing fidelity. |
| FUT-3 | Personalized Study Plans | Adaptive recommendations across sessions. | Needs historical analytics engine. |
| FUT-4 | Educator Dashboard | Cohort tracking & trend charts. | Out of scope for single-user PoC. |
| FUT-5 | Cloud Sync | Sync sessions across devices. | Adds auth + backend infra. |
| FUT-6 | ML Calibrated Scoring | Data-driven band prediction model. | Needs labeled dataset. |
