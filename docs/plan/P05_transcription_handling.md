# P05 â€“ Transcription Orchestration & Options (Priority 1)

Goal: Orchestrate transcription lifecycle, manage model selection, and allow fallback modes.

## Outcomes
- Unified transcription service interface.
- Primary path: batch STT.
- Optional flags for realtime or audio completions (hook only in MVP).
- Normalization (punctuation, casing, disfluency markers optional).
