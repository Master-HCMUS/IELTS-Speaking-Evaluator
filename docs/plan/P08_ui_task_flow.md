# P08 – Task 2 Session UI Flow (Priority 1)

Goal: Provide minimal but clear UX for selecting a cue card, timing prep & speaking, recording, and transitioning to results.

## Screens
1. Cue Card & Prep Timer (60s) + Notes area.
2. Speaking Screen with 120s countdown + level meter + record/redo.
3. Processing State (upload/transcribe spinner with progress text).
4. Results Screen (see P09 for details) linkage.

## Tasks
| ID | Task | Description | Est | Owner | Status | Notes |
|----|------|-------------|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| UI-1 | Wireframes | Low-fidelity wireframes for the 4 screens. | 2h |  | Not Started | |
| UI-2 | Timer Components | Reusable timer (prep/speak) with events. | 2h |  | Not Started | |
| UI-3 | Notes Component | Simple editable text persisted in session. | 1h |  | Not Started | |
| UI-4 | Recording Controls | Start/stop/redo button states. | 2h |  | Not Started | |
| UI-5 | State Machine | Session state transitions (prep→speak→processing→results). | 3h |  | Not Started | |
| UI-6 | Basic Styling | High-contrast compliant theme. | 2h |  | Not Started | |
| UI-7 | Integration | Connect to audio + transcription trigger. | 3h |  | Not Started | |

## Definition of Done
- End-to-end manual flow produces a stored session and navigates to results placeholder.
